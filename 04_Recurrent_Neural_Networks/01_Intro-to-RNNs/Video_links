RNN Resources

Here are a few resources to learn more about recurrent neural networks.

-	A great blog post by Christopher Olah on how LSTMs work.
	http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/

-	Building an RNN from the ground up, this is a little more advanced, but has an implementation in TensorFlow.
